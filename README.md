# NBA Trade DeadlineAnalysis

Let's get a better understanding of who got traded during the deadline, a read of all the packages that got moved, and a working understanding of how the dynamics of this NBA season may have shifted. Here are the following steps that I plan to take.

    Pull all the trade data (Anything from start of season to Feb 6 2025)
    Clean it up in a way that's easy to read. Then visualize the nodes teams) and the assets moved (edges).
    See what each team's P+R+A delta may have changed.
